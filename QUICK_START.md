## üé® Adding Your Content

### 1. Case Image (Priority: HIGH)

```
Location: public/images/case/rush_case.png
Size: 512x512px or larger
Format: PNG with transparency
Style: CS:GO case style (glossy, 3D)
```

**Tip:** Use AI image generators (Midjourney, DALL-E) with prompt:
"3D rendered CS:GO weapon case, glossy metallic surface, gold accents, transparent background"

### 2. Item Images (Priority: HIGH)

```
Location: public/images/items/
Files: ak47_redline.png, awp_asiimov.png, etc.
Size: 256x256px (consistent)
Format: PNG with transparency
```

**Where to get CS:GO skin images:**
- Steam Community Market (screenshot items)
- CS:GO wiki sites
- CSGOFloat, Buff163 (they have item images)
- Or use placeholders with rarity colors for now

### 3. Case Items Data (Priority: HIGH)

Edit `data/rush_case_items.json`:

**CRITICAL:** Probabilities MUST sum to 1.0!

Example for a balanced case:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {"probability": 0.40, "rarity": "consumer", ...},    // 40% chance
    {"probability": 0.25, "rarity": "industrial", ...},  // 25% chance
    {"probability": 0.15, "rarity": "mil-spec", ...},    // 15% chance
    {"probability": 0.10, "rarity": "restricted", ...},  // 10% chance
    {"probability": 0.06, "rarity": "classified", ...},  //  6% chance
    {"probability": 0.03, "rarity": "covert", ...},      //  3% chance
    {"probability": 0.01, "rarity": "special", ...}      //  1% chance (knife!)
  ]
}
```

### 4. Sound Files (Priority: MEDIUM)

```
public/sounds/tick.mp3        - Rapid click during spin (0.1s)
public/sounds/reveal.mp3      - Final reveal (1-2s)
public/sounds/win_common.mp3  - Low rarity win
public/sounds/win_rare.mp3    - Mid rarity win
public/sounds/win_epic.mp3    - High rarity win
public/sounds/win_legendary.mp3 - Knife/special win
```

**Option 1:** Extract from CS:GO game files (if you own it)
**Option 2:** Find free alternatives on Freesound.org, Zapsplat
**Option 3:** I can help you locate specific CS:GO sound files

## üîê Setting Up Real Payments

Currently in **DEMO MODE** (no real money):

1. Get your BNB wallet address (from MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
2. Open `.env.local`
3. Replace: `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourAddressHere`
4. Change: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false`
5. **Test on BNB testnet first!**

## üéµ About the Sounds

You mentioned wanting the **exact CS:GO case opening sounds**. Here's what to know:

**The Sounds You Want:**
1. **Tick sound** - The rapid "click-click-click" as items scroll
2. **Reveal sound** - The final "whoosh" when it stops
3. **Win sounds** - Different sounds for different rarity tiers

**Legal Note:**
- Official CS:GO sounds are copyrighted by Valve
- Many case sites use them anyway (gray area)
- Safer option: Use "sound-alike" effects

**Where I Can Help:**
- I can guide you to extract sounds from CS:GO files if you own the game
- I can find free alternatives that sound similar
- Let me know which approach you prefer

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors:
```bash
cd caserush
npm install
```

### Page won't load:
- Check if server is running: http://localhost:3000
- Look for errors in terminal
- Check browser console (F12)

### Wallet won't connect:
- Make sure you're using a supported wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.)
- Check if wallet is on BNB Smart Chain
- Try refreshing the page

### Images not showing:
- File paths must start with `/images/...`
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
